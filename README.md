create-data
===========

Usage
-----

```bash
awk -f create-data.awk config.txt > data.csv rows=1000
```

#### Example 1 :: simple config


Given the following config template:

```
foreign_id,name
33,bobby
```

The command above will create a `data.csv` file with 1000 rows, auto-incrementing an id column so that the result looks something like this:

```
id,foreign_id,name
1,33,bobby
2,33,bobby
3,33,bobby
4,33,bobby
...
```

#### Example 2 :: id variable

Given the following config template:

```
static_fk,name,incrementing_fk,interpolated_incrementing_fk
33,bobby,{id},aaa{id}
```

The command above will create a `data.csv` file with 1000 rows, auto-incrementing an id column as well as all {id} variables, so that the result looks something like this:

```
id,static_fk,name,incrementing_fk,interpolated_incrementing_fk
1,33,bobby,1,aaa1
2,33,bobby,2,aaa2
3,33,bobby,3,aaa3
4,33,bobby,4,aaa4
...
```

#### Example 3 :: random item from array

Given the following config template:

```
foreign_id,name,date,price
[33;44],bobby,[2016-12-11 01:00:00;2016-12-10 02:00:00;2016-12-09 03:00:00],[50.00;100.00;200.00]
```

The command above will create a `data.csv` file with 1000 rows, auto-incrementing an id column as well as randomly selecting an item from each array column, so that the result looks something like this:

```
id,foreign_id,name,date,price
1,33,bobby,2016-12-11 01:00:00,200.00
2,33,bobby,2016-12-10 02:00:00,50.00
3,44,bobby,2016-12-11 01:00:00,100.00
4,33,bobby,2016-12-10 02:00:00,100.00
...
```
